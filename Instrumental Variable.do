rename ageqk ageof1stchild

*b)Create indicators for sex of children to be used in the analysis.

tabulate kidcount

gen FirstChildMale = (sexk == 0)
gen SecondChildMale = (sex2nd == 0)
gen BothChildrenMale = (sexk == 0 & sex2nd == 0)
gen BothChildrenFemale = (sexk == 1 & sex2nd == 1)
gen SameSexChildren = (sexk == sex2nd)

gen MoreThanTwoChildren = (kidcount>2)
tabulate MoreThanTwoChildren

*c) Create indicators for race/ethnicity of the mother using the racem variable.

tabulate racem
gen BlackMother = (racem==2)
gen HispanicMother = (racem==12)
gen WhiteMother = (racem==1)
gen AnotherRaceMother = (1-(racem==2)-(racem==12)-(racem==1))
tabulate AnotherRaceMother

*d) Now define the samples in the analysis:

drop MainSample
gen MainSample = (age_mother >= 21 & age_mother <= 35) /// 
                & (kidcount >= 2 & kidcount! = .) ///
                & (ageq2nd > 4 & ageq2nd! = .) ///
                & (age1stbth_moth >= 15 & age1stbth_moth! = .) ///
                & (asex == 0 & aage == 0 & aqtrbrth == 0) ///
                & (asex2nd == 0 & aage2nd == 0 & aqtrbrth == 0)

drop MarriedSample				
gen MarriedSample = (MainSample==1) ///
					& (aged! = .) ///
					& (timesmar == 1) ///
					& (marital == 0) ///
					& (unMarriedbirth == 0) ///

*4. Regression Analysis

*a) More income may give more incentives to make more children.

*b) Having same sex babies increase the incentive to have more than 2 children, whereas first and second boy decreases it.

*d) According to OLS estimates, having a third child lowers the likelihood of working by roughly 17 percentage  points, reduces the number of weeks worked annually by approximately 8â€“9, reduces the number of hours worked per week by about 6-7, and lowers family income by roughly 13 percent. These findings hold true for  both the complete sample and married women. The married sample's OLS estimates of earnings effects are $3,166, whereas the full sample's estimates are $3,768.

*e) The sign of the coefficient, namely ln(Non-wife income) changes between OLS and IV, it may mean that the OLS results were significantly biased, likely due to strong endogeneity issues. Apart from the last variable, the others might be overstated by OLS because the IV coefficient is smaller than the OLS coefficient. IV estimates for women are significant but smaller than ordinary least-squares estimates. 

*f) F-statistic = 2707.00 Extremely strong instrument.

*g) No because we have one endogenous variable and one instrumental variable.
